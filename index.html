My name is Joaquin Avaro Acosta, and I'm  passionate about web development. I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies during my university period, which has created  my enthusiasm for both front-end and back-end development.

                I have a strong foundation in Javascript, utilizing PERN(PostgreSQL,React,Node,Express)  and Mern(Mongo DB,React,Node,Express) stack to create robust applications. In addition, I've explored the world of Python with Flask, and I'm currently diving into Django to expand my skills even further.
                
                My knowledge also includes   HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap and react Bootstrap). I feel confortable working with different types of databases such as Mongo DB, Mysql or Postgres and I am open mind to learn how to use others .
                
                What excites me the most is the prospect of gaining more experience in both front-end and back-end development. I'm constantly looking for opportunities to improve my knowledge and reach new goals.
                
                Beyond the world of tech, I'm also passionate about digital marketing. I hold a diplomatura in digital marketing and community management, and I enjoy leveraging these skills to connect with audiences and build online communities.
                
                I consider my self as a team player, trying always to achieve team goals. My soft skills complement my technical abilities, making me an effective communicator and problem solver.
                
                In my free time, I'm an avid history enthusiast and a professor of history. I also have a big interest in exploring different cultures and places, so I like to travel a lot. Additionally, I have a love for sports, which I find to be a great way to meet people and enjoy .
                
                I look forward to connecting, collaborating, and exploring the exciting possibilities that the world of technology  has to offer.</p></div></article>
